Electron React Toolchain Boilerplate

This repository is meant to provide an sufficient yet efficient boilerplate for developing an React app in Electron. The repository provides a full blown Electron app that uses the components listed below(detailed list is provided further down):

1. yarn
2. flow
3. jsx
4. react
5. redux
6. saga
7. immer

The repository aims at being fully updated and providing the most efficient alternatives for developing an Electron app with React.

The repository is started as an personalization of other Electron React boilerplate repositories such as electron-react-boilerplate(https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). This means that you might not have the same preferences for all the components as I do and that is totally fine, simply fork the repository or use some other boilerplate repository.. :)

If you have any questions or things you would like to discuss with me don't hesitate to write an issue! The questions/tips could be as large as component alternatives or as small as a style discussion :)

Detailed explanation of components:

1. yarn
  https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn  
  Simple and nice way to handle packages. Speed and security trumps npm, see https://medium.com/@j.dumadag718/yarn-vs-npm-b2d58289fb9b. For me, the UI is also a bit more intuitive.

2. flow
  https://github.com/facebook/flow  
  A nice way to add static type checks to javascript. The reason to go with flow instead of typescript is as simple as: no reason at all, if typescript could work better for the repo these two will be swapped.  
  // TODO How to use it in the repository
  
3. JSX
  https://github.com/facebook/jsx  
  JSX comes natural with React.
  
4. React
  https://github.com/facebook/react
  Simply the best library for UI and it is the one I am comfortable with.
